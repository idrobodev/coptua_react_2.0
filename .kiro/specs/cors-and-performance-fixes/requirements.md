# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues affecting the application's development experience and production functionality. The application is experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when communicating with the backend API at localhost:8080, preventing successful authentication and API calls. Additionally, there are performance issues related to hot reload and unnecessary re-renders that degrade the development experience and potentially impact production performance.

The solution will implement proper CORS handling, optimize React component rendering, and improve the development workflow to ensure smooth operation in both development and production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CORS Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to successfully communicate with the backend API without CORS errors, so that authentication and data fetching work correctly in both development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes a request to the backend API THEN the backend SHALL include proper CORS headers in the response
2. WHEN a preflight OPTIONS request is sent THEN the backend SHALL respond with appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, and Access-Control-Allow-Headers
3. WHEN the API client is configured THEN it SHALL use the correct base URL for the environment (development vs production)
4. IF the backend is not available THEN the frontend SHALL display a clear error message to the user
5. WHEN credentials are included in requests THEN the backend SHALL properly handle withCredentials configuration

### Requirement 2: API Service Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling in the API service, so that network failures and CORS issues are properly caught and reported to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN a CORS error is detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed debugging information to the console
3. WHEN the API returns an error response THEN the system SHALL extract and display the error message from the response body
4. WHEN authentication fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL NOT redirect to login unnecessarily
5. WHEN the health check endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL indicate the backend is unavailable

### Requirement 3: React Component Re-render Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React components to re-render only when necessary, so that the application performs efficiently and hot reload works smoothly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN context values are provided THEN they SHALL be properly memoized using useMemo
2. WHEN callback functions are defined in contexts THEN they SHALL be memoized using useCallback
3. WHEN a component receives props THEN it SHALL only re-render if those props have actually changed
4. WHEN child components consume context THEN they SHALL only re-render when their specific context slice changes
5. WHEN the AuthContext updates THEN only components using the changed values SHALL re-render

### Requirement 4: Hot Reload Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hot reload to work reliably during development, so that I can see my changes immediately without full page refreshes or broken state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is saved THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the browser without a full page reload
2. WHEN React Fast Refresh is enabled THEN component state SHALL be preserved during hot reload
3. WHEN there are syntax errors THEN the error overlay SHALL display clearly without breaking the dev server
4. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL require a manual restart (documented behavior)
5. WHEN the webpack dev server is running THEN it SHALL properly handle HMR (Hot Module Replacement) updates

### Requirement 5: Development Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration for development, so that the frontend and backend can communicate correctly on different ports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts in development mode THEN it SHALL use the correct API base URL from environment variables
2. WHEN no environment variable is set THEN the system SHALL fall back to a sensible default (localhost:8080)
3. WHEN the browser opens automatically THEN it SHALL be disabled to prevent multiple tabs (BROWSER=none)
4. WHEN the dev server starts THEN it SHALL use port 3001 to avoid conflicts
5. WHEN proxy configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be properly configured in package.json or craco.config.js

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks and unnecessary re-renders, so that I can optimize the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL log render counts in development mode (optional)
2. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable debugging information
3. WHEN the PerformanceDebugOverlay is enabled THEN it SHALL display real-time performance metrics
4. WHEN context updates occur THEN the system SHALL track which components re-render as a result
5. WHEN optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL show measurable improvement in render counts
